Perhaps, not a single line of code has yet been written; alternatively, you’re looking to expand your software development workforce. So, whom will you be best off with – freelancers, an in-house team, or maybe a software house? Here’s a breakdown that might just solve your dilemma between…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":null,"comments":null,"image":"/images/Daniel_software development.png","author":"daniel","author_id":null,"title":"Is outsourced software development the best choice for me?","tags":["software development","Poland","outsourcing","software house"],"date":"2019-07-15T22:00:00.000Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019-07-16-is-outsourced-software-development-the-best-choice-for-me"}}},{"node":{"id":"658128f8-34c3-58cc-9a7b-9aae7327967f","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2019-06-10-know-your-team.md","excerpt":"The core of business is to build and maintain a great environment so everyone can do their best.  Without a comfortable environment where employees feel they can do their job, you will find that the turnover may claim its victims. But, have you ever wondered if there is a key to create a perfect workplace? I dare to say it may reach far deeper than corporate benefits and cool offices, and focus more on relationships. The relationships are frequently why some workers love their job and hate to…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":null,"comments":null,"image":"/images/Ula_blog_know_your_team.png","author":"ula","author_id":null,"title":"Know Your Team","tags":["team","engagement","work","communication"],"date":"2019-06-09T22:00:00.000Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019-06-10-know-your-team"}}},{"node":{"id":"f32b6dcb-9d3c-5277-a7fb-f67fa011f964","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2019-05-17-coming-back-to-bright-roots.md","excerpt":"Probably you have noticed that we gave our brand a face lift. We are excited to finally unveil our new look, and we want to tell you all about it.

Because of mobile devices' computation limitations, we can't migrate all of the available models to work on mobile. Unfortunately, plenty of them won't work on mobile devices but that's fine because we often don't need these heavy models on mobile devices.

While you may seem tired and bored of a long day at work, they just can't stand waiting to leave the office in a great mood just to do tons of other stuff. How are they doing it? Why do they decide to spend their own, precious, free time just in order to work more? \nI am known to be one of these freaks, and I think there is only one reason we do it… It’s because we choose projects, that we actually…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":null,"comments":null,"image":null,"author":"olo","author_id":null,"title":"Traits of a great side project","tags":["programming","after-hours","motivation"],"date":"2019-04-28T22:00:00.000Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019-04-29-traits-of-a-great-side-project"}}},{"node":{"id":"b2947a46-aed1-507b-b544-72fdeb93c088","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2019-04-24-mistakes-startups-make-when-developing-their-mobile-product.md","excerpt":"If you’ve ever worked at an early-stage startup, then I’m sure you know the feeling – your mobile app, a concept you’ve been working intensely on for many months, is finally entering development phase. Things are starting to feel very real business-wise, aren’t they? On the one hand, you’re pumped from all the excitement.
