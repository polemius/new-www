They do not add immediately perceivable value. They are difficult to guess get right and force one to consider problems that are hard to solve. In fact, in my experience, the timeout is only ever considered when our software stops working or is about to. That is an enormous shame since, in my opinion, carefully applied timeouts can vastly improve software resiliency.
