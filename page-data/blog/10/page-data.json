Android Manifest placeholders allow you to put variables into the Manifest that is otherwise completely static. Why would you need such functionality? Actually, it depends on your projects. It's probably most useful when you have multiple build variants with different Manifest configurations. Multiple Manifests Of course, the easiest way to configure Manifest per build variant is to place a separate AndroidManifest.xml file in the variant-specific source directory.

Over those years developers have found many ways of doing it. Some of these ways are quite fast, others involve  interesting methods and finally there are some which are practically useless, but still it is better to know more than to know less, so it’s better to learn them  in free time.
