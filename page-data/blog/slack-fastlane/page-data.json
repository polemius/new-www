Some of these puzzles can be: unit testing, choosing good architecture, clean code, continuous integration and many  more.\nIn this post I will focus on one of these puzzles - Continuous Integration(CI). An integral part of CI in iOS Development process is a great tool called <a href=\"https://fastlane.tools/\">Fastlane</a>.\nFastlane is a powerful engine which handles a number of tasks like: dealing with code signing, creating <code>.ipa</code> files, generating screenshots to AppStore and much more. One of the cool feature of Fastlane is the Slack integration - and this is what I wanted to write about.</p>\n<h1>üí™ Motivation üí™</h1>\n<p>At Bright Inventions, I'm working on a several projects. Every project that we start, we start with a few basic steps: create a new repository, basic application setup and most important... Continuous Integration path. On iOS applications, it starts with  installing the Fastlane, creating some lanes in Fastfile, then pushing changes to our new repository. Next step is configuring a new TeamCity   (a service that we are using for CI) with a new agent machine for the project. And after that... our CI build service is ready to collect changes from the repository and trigger a build for our clients, or just build the application and run our unit/UI tests to check if everything works fine.</p>\n<p>But what if something went wrong...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/error.jpg\" alt=\"Error image\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<p>Let's say that we were doing some code refactoring, we committed the changes and pushed into our repository. Next, our build system discovered that there were  available new commits - so it started to fetch and built them and ran unit tests. And here some tests failed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/test-failed.png\" alt=\"TeamCity tests failed\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<p>Of course, I don't have constantly an opened browser to check on the Teamcity site if everything goes  well when I push something to the repository. I want to be informed if something goes wrong like - if  unit tests fails or timeout appears or compilation error happens. And here is the key word - INFORMED. How our build agent can inform us about an occurred error?</p>\n<h3>Emails</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/email.jpeg\" alt=\"Image with computer and email\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<p>We use email service which is built-in into TeamCity. Every built lane has a rule which says 'send email to all developers when something goes wrong and build fails'. This solution works fine and it's commonly used in many projects and companies. But personally, I'm not 100% satisfied with it. If you work in several projects, you get more and more emails from clients, Jira, team etc. And let's add to that getting new emails from our TeamCity service. Of course, I can create filters and group all the  stuff(which I do), but even then it's too much for me. Besides, there is a new thing - if some builds fail - in most cases, it is important to <strong>fix it quick</strong>. So I prefer another - quicker in my opinion - way to be notified if something bad happens.</p>\n<h1>‚ù§Ô∏è Fastlane + Slack ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>\n<h2>1. Create your Fastfile in right way</h2>\n<p>Let's consider a simple example. One lane which compiles the project and runs the unit tests:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">platform :ios do\ndesc \"Runs all the tests\"\nlane :test do\n   begin\n       test_lane()\n   rescue => exception\n       on_error(exception)\n   end\nend\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see the body of <code>:test</code> lane consists of <code>begin-rescue-end</code> structure. It is a ruby specific construction. In <code>begin</code> you put some code that may fail. After the <code>rescue => exception</code> line you put the code that should be executed if something goes wrong. In our case, it will be <code>on_error(exception)</code> function. So the Fastfile should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">platform :ios do\n   desc \"Runs all the tests\"\n   lane :test do\n       begin\n           test_lane()\n       rescue => exception\n           on_error(exception)\n       end\n   end\nend\n\n### Methods\n\ndef test_lane\n   cocoapods\n   clear_derived_data\n   scan(scheme: \"YourProjectSchemeName\", configuration: \"Debug\")\nend\n\ndef on_error(exception)\n   slack(\n       message: \"Some thing goes wrong\",\n       success: false,\n       slack_url: \"https://your slack incoming webhook url\",\n       attachment_properties: {\n           fields: [\n               {\n                   title: \"Build number\",\n                   value: ENV[\"BUILD_NUMBER\"],\n               },\n               {\n                   title: \"Error message\",\n                   value: exception.to_s,\n                   short: false\n               }\n           ]\n       }\n   )\nend\n</code></pre>\n<h2>2. Generate slack URL</h2>\n<p>As you probably have noticed <code>slack</code> method takes a <code>slack_url</code> parameter. But how can I get one?</p>\n<h3>Create incoming webhook</h3>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/\">slack incoming weebhook webiste</a>, log in, and after that you will be able too see screen like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/webhook-slack-url.png\" alt=\"Slack website - choose chanel for webhook\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<p>Choose your channel (for test purposes, I recommend choosing a direct message to yourself). Click <code>Add incoming WebHooks integration</code>.\nNext step is to copy the Webhook URL and use it as <code>slack_url</code>.</p>\n<p>Of course, after you learn how it works, you can generate a URL for specially created Channel in your slack team.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/webhook-slack-url2.png\" alt=\"Slack website - webhook URL image\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<h2>3. Build Slack message in Fastfile</h2>\n<p>First of all, <a href=\"https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/slack/\">here</a> you can find an official documentation for Slack action in Fastlane tool. In the below  section I'll try to give you a closer look at that.</p>\n<p>Code for that is really simple. Let's create a simple <code>slack_message</code> lane to test how it works.\nPut a new lane in you Fastfile, and then just run:</p>\n<p><code>fastlane slack_message</code>,</p>\n<p>or if you are using a bundler</p>\n<p><code>bundle exec fastlane slack_message</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">platform :ios do\n   desc \"Runs all the tests\"\n   lane :slack_message do\n       slack(\n           message: \"App successfully uploaded to iTunesConnect.\",\n           success: true,\n           slack_url: \"https://your slack incoming webhook url\"\n       )\n   end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is how our message looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/basic-message.png\" alt=\"Slack basic message from Fastlane\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<p>As you can see by default you get some information about <code>Git Commit</code>, <code>Git Commit Hash</code>, <code>Lane</code>, <code>Result</code>, <code>Git Author</code>.</p>\n<h1>üîß Customizing slack message üîß</h1>\n<h4>üëâ <code>message</code></h4>\n<p>Simple key for creating a message which will be display in a first row in Slack message. This can be literally everything.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>message: \"App Successfully uploaded to iTunesConnect\"</code></li>\n<li><code>message: \"All tests have been successful\"</code></li>\n<li><code>message: \"Something went wrong\"</code> - My favorite error message üòâ</li>\n</ul>\n<p>but try to make your Slack message useful. As you can see above in my <code>Fastfile</code> I use a <code>begin-rescue</code> construction in Ruby. It is very useful because you can use an exception passed as a parameter to and create some meaningful error message.</p>\n<p>I assume that all of you use and know <a href=\"https://cocoapods.org/\">CococaPods</a>. Let's imagine situation that our <code>Podfile</code> has a typo</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">platform :ios, '10.0'\ninhibit_all_warnings!\n\ntarget 'MyAppTarget' do\n use_frameworks!\n\n # Pods for MyApp\n podd 'SnapKit' # &#x3C;------- should fail because of `podd`\n pod 'Result'\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now create a lane in our <code>Fastfile</code> that will install our CocoaPods, and build the project.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">fastlane_version \"2.54.1\"\n\ndefault_platform :ios\n\nxcode_select ENV[\"XCODE_PATH\"]\n\nplatform :ios do\n   desc \"Runs all the tests\"\n   lane :build_and_test do\n       begin\n           build_and_test_lane()\n       rescue => exception\n           on_error(exception)\n       end\n   end\nend\n\ndef build_and_test_lane\n   cocoapods\n   clear_derived_data\n   scan(scheme: \"MyAppScheme\", configuration: \"Debug\")\nend\n\ndef on_error(exception)\n       slack(\n           message: \"Lane failed with exception : #{exception}\",\n           success: false,\n           slack_url: \"https://slackurl\",\n       )\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see if something goes  wrong in <code>build_and_test_lane</code> method our script will get an <code>exception</code> and run the <code>on_error(exception)</code> method.\nLet's try it by...</p>\n<p><code>fastlane build_and_test</code> or <code>bundle exec fastlane build_and_test</code></p>\n<p>wait some time.... and...üîî üîî</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/exception.png\" alt=\"Slack message with error in message\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<p>Now our message is meaningful and we know that our <code>Podfile</code> has some errors.</p>\n<h4>üëâ  <code>deafult_payloads</code></h4>\n<p>As we can read in the documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't add this key or pass nil if you want all the default payloads. The available default payloads are: <code>lane</code>, <code>test_result</code>, <code>git_branch</code>, <code>git_author</code>, <code>last_git_commit_message</code>, <code>last_git_commit_hash</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Personally, I think it is very important information, but if you want to customize the message by removing some of those - you can look at this example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">slack(\n   message: \"App successfully uploaded to iTunesConnect.\",\n   success: true,\n   slack_url: \"https://your slack incoming webhook url\",\n   default_payloads: [:git_branch, :last_git_commit_message]\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is how a message with customized <code>default_payloads</code> looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/default-payload-message.png\" alt=\"Slack message with default payload\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<h4>üëâ  <code>success</code></h4>\n<p>You can also define if that message will be successful or not. Among other cases, success messages can be used if your app is successfully uploaded to iTunesConnect.</p>\n<p>Second option is to set <code>success</code> to <code>false</code>, and then a message will look a bit different:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/message-fail.png\" alt=\"Slack message with success flag set to false\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<p>The red color suggests that something went wrong and you have to fix it, which is a great way to notify you about it.</p>\n<h4>üëâ  <code>attachment_properties</code></h4>\n<p>Here  a real customizing process begins. By using this property you can add any field to your Slack message. Let's say that you want to add <code>BUILD_NUMBER</code> and <code>URL</code> to artifacts.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">slack(\n   message: \"App successfully uploaded to iTunesConnect.\",\n   success: true,\n   slack_url: \"https://your slack incoming webhook url\",\n   default_payloads: [:git_branch, :last_git_commit_message],\n   attachment_properties: {\n       fields: [\n           {\n               title: \"Build number\",\n               value: ENV[\"BUILD_NUMBER\"],\n           },\n           {\n               title: \"Artifacts URL\",\n               value: \"https://url-to-your-artifacts.com\",\n           }\n       ]\n   }\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/message-with-custom-fields.png\" alt=\"Slack message with custom fields\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<p>Another example... let's modify our <code>on_error(exception)</code> method.</p>\n<pre><code>def on_error(exception)\n       slack(\n           message: \"Error occured!\",\n           success: false,\n           slack_url: \"https://slackurl\",\n           attachment_properties: {\n               fields: [\n                   {\n                       title: \"Error message\",\n                       value: exception\n                   }\n               ]\n           }\n       )\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>and here we've got a message üîîüîî</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/slack-fastlane/exception2.png\" alt=\"Slack message with error in custom field\">{: .center-image}</p>\n<p>As you can see, now the error message is custom field.</p>\n<h4>üëâ  other flags...</h4>\n<p>In this post I have focused, in my humble opinion, on the most important keys which allow you to configure  Slack message. The others are: <code>channel</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>use_webhook_configured_username_and_icon</code>, <code>icon_url</code>, <code>payload</code>. More information about these keys you can find on <a href=\"https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/slack/\">official documentation</a>.</p>\n<h1>üéâ Conclusion üéâ</h1>\n<p>I ‚ù§Ô∏è  Fastlane tool. It helps all developers to save a lot of time during development process. I think  one of the puzzles of this process is Continuous Integration <strong><em>in the full sense of the word</em></strong>. How do I understand the Continuous Integration? As you can read about it on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration\">wikipedia</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is 100% true, but for me, it is also a state when I as a developer can be notified by CI agent about successes and errors without specially checking them before pushing changes to the repository. But don't get me wrong. I don't recommend committing and pushing without compiling (because our CI agent inform us when something fails). I'm talking about a situation when you have a number of projects that contain a number of tests (Yes, I assume you're writing tests üòâ). And I think you don't want to run them every time before you push new changes to the repository. That's why, you configure the whole CI stuff to avoid it. Let CI agent do it for you. In most cases all the tests will succeed üòâ), so you can work continuously. But if somehow tests fail - let the CI agent ping you on a Slack.    üòâ\nAnother thing is that, you can be informed about good things like: successfully uploaded <code>.ipa</code> to TestFlight.</p>\n<p>Hope you like the post.
