Throughout the years, we’ve made a name for ourselves in a whole array of services, including idea consulting, product design, software development, IoT and Blockchain.</p>\n<p>The company was established in 2012, when the Founders, Michał Łukasiewicz and Daniel Makurat, decided to create a place where innovative individuals and companies could turn to develop their  ideas – all without tedious bureaucracy and formalities, the place where the team will be able to focus on creating software solutions that matter. </p>\n<h2><strong>Our projects</strong></h2>\n<p>Throughout the years, we’ve been blessed with the opportunity to work on projects of the worldwide impact – both directly with the client and in the white-label model. </p>\n<p>Most prominently, we’ve been entrusted by a global humanitarian organization with the development of a Blockchain-based transaction system which aims at obliterating world hunger. </p>\n<p>We’ve also helped bring an innovative emergency &#x26; rescue app into the market, as well as developed revolutionary, Android-based point-of-sales software for a world-leading food delivery ordering company.</p>\n<h2>Our values</h2>\n<p>At Bright Inventions, we’re truly invested in each project – just as if they were our own. This means that in our work with clients we’re not driven by financial gains, nor do we take on all projects.</p>\n<p>When a potential customer turns to us with an idea, we put our hearts and souls into testing it against the competition and market needs. If we believe a project should not be developed due to its low chances of success, we offer our guidance and verify if there’s room for a promising pivot.</p>\n<p>This all comes down to the fact that “Bright Inventions” is more than just our brand name. It’s also a term that truly reflects who we are and what we do.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are looking for a long-term partner who will help you build reliable and scalable software systems, talk to our team and find out more about how we work. Remember that your project is our project - we always share with you ideas for the best possible outcomes.</strong></p>","excerpt":"On 3-4 Dec we will be attending FinTech Connect, the UK's leading
