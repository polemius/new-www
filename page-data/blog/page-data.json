After 5 minutes of participating you start to wonder what it is about. It feels like a total waste of your valuable time. You lose your focus and listen with only half an ear. Probably in the meantime you start to do some of your other tasks for today. Then, if someone asks you, you don’t even know what the question was about. Sounds familiar? Depending on the organisation, its size and culture, you have probably already experienced that several times. Good news is: you can…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":null,"comments":true,"image":"/images/team_meetings.jpg","author":"kasia g","author_id":null,"title":"Why am I here?

In structural typing, an element is considered to be compatible \nwith another if, for each feature within the second element's type, a corresponding and identical feature exists in the \nfirst element's type. Sometimes this behavior may allow us to write erroneous code.  Example Let's imagine a function which calculates candy price based on their weight and price per unit: TypeScript compiler does not throw an error, even though we…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":null,"comments":true,"image":"/images/branding_and_flavoring.png","author":"wojciech","author_id":null,"title":"Branding & Flavoring","tags":["typescript","types","candies","veggies"],"date":"2021-01-08T12:12:12.000Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-01-08-branding-flavoring"}}},{"node":{"id":"e5de2b79-52c1-5b9e-8eb3-2b3efd1212c9","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2021-01-06-request-typing.md","excerpt":"Introduction As a developers we often perform POST and PATCH requests to API from our frontend apps.

Let's find out in three steps! Step 1 - Sets This topic is not so straightforward so let's start with an intuitive example from life with a little of mathematical knowledge. Think about a vehicle and a motorbike. Vehicle is a superset for a motorbike and motorbike is a subset for a vehicle.

In 1978 J.M. Darley and C.D. Batson constructed the experiment in which they tested the possible facts behind the modern version of the parable of Good Samaritan concerning altruistic behaviours. The experiment showed that the major reason why people didn’t stop to offer some help to a victim was the haste of their lives.

It’s basically a shortcut for a team of people focused on a shared goal for some specific time. We are used to terms like “project success” or “project management”.

Engineers usually find automation testing hard to describe in detail, especially to a less-technical person.
