I used to write lots of very focused, narrow unit tests. However, I often found such tests to hinder refactoring and barely help in catching regressions. Whether such issues were caused by my poor design choices or are intrinsic to unit tests is not the focus of this post. However, the fact is that nowadays I tend to write more coarse-grained, integration style tests. There is one downside to such approach: speed.
