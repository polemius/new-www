Have you ever asked yourself this kind of question? Have you ever felt that maybe you should take a break instead of writing a code, but you choose to code? Coding is not just writing a code. It is writing the code. And by doing that you solve a problem, frequently the problem of your clients. By writing the code you agree to be consistent with the language, platform, architecture and the whole system. You agree to follow all the principles of good…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":null,"comments":true,"image":null,"author":"ula","author_id":null,"title":"To code or not to code","tags":["programming","coding","work-life","balance"],"date":"2017-08-02T22:00:00.000Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017-08-03-to-code-or-not-to-code"}}},{"node":{"id":"60380c97-d156-571e-9f6c-d468ff13436b","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2017-07-07-bright-devs-disappearing-in-gdansk.1.md","excerpt":"It was pleasure for us to take part in Summer Course \"DisAPPear in Gdańsk\".
