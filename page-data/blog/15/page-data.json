Every employer knows that motivated and committed team values nowadays more than ever. Yet engagement does not equal to employees' satisfaction or their happiness since someone can come to work every day with a big grin on their face, yet it does not have to mean they work productively on the behalf of the organisation.

Calling a real database can increase our confidence that a tested code actually works. Having said that a database, by its very nature, brings external state into a test that will affect its behavior, hence we need to pay special attention to prepare the test execution. There are couple of ways to handle the database state in tests and I'm going to describe an approach I like most.

Maybe you’re a leader and wonder whether the silence of your team mates is golden. Sometimes debates are raised and last long after the meetings end.
