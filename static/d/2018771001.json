After 5 minutes of participating you start to wonder what it is about. It feels like a total waste of your valuable time. You lose your focus and listen with only half an ear. Probably in the meantime you start to do some of your other tasks for today. Then, if someone asks you, you don’t even know what the question was about. Sounds familiar? Depending on the organisation, its size and culture, you have probably already experienced that several times.

In structural typing, an element is considered to be compatible \nwith another if, for each feature within the second element's type, a corresponding and identical feature exists in the \nfirst element's type. Sometimes this behavior may allow us to write erroneous code.  Example Let's imagine a function which calculates candy price based on their weight and price per unit: TypeScript compiler does not throw an error, even though we…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":null,"comments":true,"image":"/images/branding_and_flavoring.png","author":"wojciech","title":"Branding & Flavoring","tags":["typescript","types","candies","veggies"],"date":"2021-01-08T12:12:12.000Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-01-08-branding-flavoring"}}},{"post":{"id":"e5de2b79-52c1-5b9e-8eb3-2b3efd1212c9","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2021-01-06-request-typing.md","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"Introduction As a developers we often perform POST and PATCH requests to API from our frontend apps.
